										        <h3>Industries make the switch to carbon credits</h3>
										        <p>Developed countries have thought of a way to cut back on the ill effects of industrial carbon pollutants, 

													which cause green house gases. They buy carbon credits from developing nations to offset their carbon 

													emissions.
													</p>
												<p>
													Measures by the Kyoto Protocol were created to encourage industries in developing countries to adhere 

													to specific standards. These standards under quotas, provide an assigned amount units (AAUs) credits 

													to emit one metric tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent. The utilisation of carbon credits are monitored 

													and validated by the United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC). Industries 

													that have not utilised all their carbon credits sell their carbon credits and businesses that exceed the 

													quota, buy extra allowances on credit.
													</p>
												<p>
													India and China are the largest sellers of carbon credits and India contributes $1 billion out of the total 

													of $5 billion. On the other hand, Europe is the largest buyer of carbon credits. 

													The Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) has set stricter 

													standards for coal-based thermal power plants in India. The standards include a reduction in emissions 

													of particulate matter by 25 per cent, mercury by 75 per cent, sulphur dioxide by 90 per cent and 

													nitrogen oxide by 70 per cent and cut water wastage. This will ensure that more industries follow suit 

													in accordance with the Paris agreement of 2015.
													</p>
												<p>
													One hundred and fourteen projects were registered in India, making it the highest for any country. In 

													2011, Reliance Power gained the approval of carbon credits at an estimated Rs.20 billion over a 10 year 

													period. Recently, the United Nations certified the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation as the only rail-based 

													and metro rail in the entire globe to gain from carbon credits by reducing the greenhouse gas emissions 

													by 6.3 lakh tons since inception.
													</p>
												<p>
													Under the National Clean Development Mechanism Authority (NCDMA), 2195 projects have been 

													approved. The NCDMA has estimated a revenue generation though the sale of carbon credits to a tune 

													of over Rs.10,000 crores. The Tata Group, Reliance, Bajaj, Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited, ITC and 

													Adani are some of largest Indian corporations that are beneficiaries of CDM.

													The Paris agreement has passed a resolution to create a carbon market to regulate the buying and 

													selling of carbon credits. With the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change 

													enforcing new standards, more industries will register with NCDMA and UNFCCC to benefit from 

													carbon credits and create less polluting and greener industries.

										        <h3>Make the switch: Fresh fruit vs Processed food</h3>
										        <p>Bangalore is known for the fast paced workforce that at the blink of an eye, conducts transactions that 

													are worth millions of dollars. It is this lack for time and the constant advertisement of fast food and 

													beverages that processed food becomes a part of the staple diet for many. Millions are hooked on to 

													these products and for most, it is simply a part of their shopping list at the local department store. 
													</p>

													<i>The effects of Cola's in India</i>
													</p>
												<p>
													The Cola wars have only led to the depletion of the ground water table in different regions across the 

													country. Since 2005, Pepsi and Coca-Cola have captured an estimated 95% of all sales in India. Coca-

													Cola's recently announced on CNN Money that they would replenish 'every drop of water' that they 

													have used since they initiated their plants by 2020. This is due to the over-exploitation of limited water 

													resources and the contamination of groundwater supplies. At Plachimada in Kerala in 2000, the state 

													government ordered the plant to shut down as the region surrounding the plant was faced with drought 

													and polluted water.
													</p>
												<p>
													The Cola heavyweights have a strong presence in the local government bodies as the World Bank 

													promotes the privatization of water. By cutting off the government bodies from controlling canals and 

													irrigation programmes, these companies draw millions of gallons of water at rates of 3 cents per litre.
													</p>
												<p>
													<i>PlantBottle damage the environment</i>
													</p>
												<p>
													The PlantBottle, introduced in 2010, is a one of a kind PET bottle manufactured by Coca-Cola, in 

													which the company states that is fully recyclable and made partially from sugarcane.

													Three main arguments state that Coca-Cola reduces their dependency on fossil fuels and improves the 

													chances of the bottle being recyclable. The issue is that these bottles cannot be recycled as bioplastics 

													are not reusable. Bioplastics contain polylactic acid that is made from corn starch, tapioca, or sugar 

													cane. This form of plastic is removed from regular plastic as recycling centres and treated as waste. The 

													regular PET and HDPE manufacturers produce the right level of flexibility and clarity and the plant-

													based versions may also contain them. These bottles are made identical to the chemically made bottles 

													in spite of the bottles containing renewable and lower-carbon sources.
													</p>
												<p>
													<i>Benefits of Fresh Fruit Juice</i>
													</p>
												<p>
													From the fresh fruit juices which are pressed by cart vendors, you can derive many benefits like 

													assisting with digestion, providing energy, enriching and renewing blood cells. Additionally, natural 

													fruit juice protects you against oxidation which is caused due to chemicals that are within the processed 

													juices.
													</p>
												<p>
													Sweet Lime juices provides a good dosage of Vitamin C. Since it belongs to the citrus family, it 

													protects against arthiritis and protects against inflammation of tissues. The folic acid present in the 

													juice that helps with bone and joint health. 
													</p>
												<p>
													Unlike processed juices which contain a fructose concentration of nearly 45.5 grams per litre, fresh 

													juice provides you with healthy minerals that are good for the body. The fructose found in processed 

													juices is converted to fat which leads to diabetes, heart and liver disease in many.

													So make the switch, protect the environment from harmful chemicals seeping into the ground water 

													table, non recyclable PET bottles and unhealthy carbonated drinks and processed foods which are bad 

													for you.

										        <h3>How Hoskote became water independent</h3>
										        <p>The farmers in Kuruballahalli, Hoskote were faced with a dilemma. After several years of heavy

													utilisation of water due to irrigating cash crops like roses, the water table had depleted to levels 

													past 1000 metres. It was ignorance of how that water got there in the first place. They thought it 

													was a never ending supply.
</p>
												<p>
													Roses need a lot of water to grow and since electricity is given free to the farmers, they left their 

													pumps running exploiting and depleting the ground water table, letting the water be pumped out 

													for as long as there was electricity.
</p>
												<p>
													These days farmers have to spend several lakhs to find newer and newer and deeper bore wells. 

													That was when the government and the World Bank stepped in and began to educate them on 

													harvesting the rain on their land. The farmers were trained to dig trenches on the land, to hold 

													back the run- off and let it percolate into the soil. 
</p>
												<p>
													Slowly, the government helped fund  and built check dams and began to line the walls of the 

													drains to hold the run off for the rain water. After a heavy downpour, the rain water would back 

													up against the check dam and slowly percolate into the soil and replenish the entire ground water 

													table.  A small pond was dug and water collected in it from different areas in the village.

													JCB's have been pressed into use to dig out large ponds in the village by the government and the 

													ponds are being lined with thick plastic sheets so the water is saved to be used in particular 

													fields. The efficacy of saving all rain water to help themselves has become a rule in this village 

													in Hoskote. 
</p>
												<p>
													“For the last five years we have been buying tankers of water and we can't afford it,” said 

													Narsimappa, a farmer in the village.  After a meeting with the Chairman, he understood that it 

													was the harvested rain water to irrigate his land. He added, “On my land I blocked all the run off 

													with trenches and when it rained we ran out to check that no water could leave our land."

													The village got together and started using an old and defunct stone quarry to store water and reap 

													the benefits of pure and pristine rain water for their crops. The Thasildar of the village maintains 

													rain water charts everyday and continues to press forward with other methods to save water and 

													reduce the excess seepage into the soil.

										        <h3>Mango trees flowering in December?</h3>
										        <p>Bangaloreans have been subject to the extremes of weather with dry monsoons, hot summers and 

													winters that have set in late. This creates unusual temperatures for the mango tree that flowers normally 

													in late March/ April to bring us fruit in June and after.
													</p>
												<p>
													Over the past few years, across Bangalore, mango trees have been flowering from November. This 

													creates an offset in the cycle as the trees bear fruit at odd intervals, which were previously unheard of. 

													The blooms are not just a small streak of flowers but the entire tree is encompassed with flowers.

													Rajiv Mathias, Photographer and Former Alumni of St. Joseph's College explains, “It is exciting yet 

													sad for the trees as we now get to enjoy mangoes at unseasonal times. The reason for this is based on 

													the odd climate that these trees are facing.”
													</p>
												<p>
													In Karnataka, mango trees yield 1,130 thousand metric tons of mangoes and makes the states the fifth 

													largest producer of mangoes in the country. The crop accounts for nearly 23% of all fruit produced in 

													India. The largest mango growing belts in Karnataka are Kolar, Bangalore, Tumkur and Kagu. The 

													Mallika, Dashahari, Alfanzo, Chausa and Himsagar are the some of the cash crops of states like Bihar 

													and account for good results.
													</p>
												<p>
													According to the National Department of Agriculture, South Africa, the Mango crop can be harvested 

													in most warm climatic conditions, ranging from very hot, very humid to cool and dry, to very hot and 

													arid and can survive in temperatures of 45 oC. The mango trees require to flower for a minimum of two 

													months before the trees bear fruit.
													</p>
												<p>
													Maharastra had recorded that 80% of the state's crop was ruined due to climate change. In 2011, the 

													state produced only 7,000 boxes of mangoes instead of 70,000 boxes that year due to unseasonal 

													weather patterns.
													</p>
												<p>
													A.N. Yellappa Reddy, the Former Secretary, Department of Ecology and Environment says, “The trees 

													are subject to a rise in temperature and due to the amount of smoke of the vehicular traffic. 

													Temperature is the main element that modulates whether the mango tree would flower and eventually 

													fruit.”
													</p>
												<p>
													Though these unseasonal flowering of the mango trees remains scientifically unproven, there remains a 

													sense of certainty that Climate Change is a key driving factor in creating this vicious cycle, which is 

													sad for mango lovers across the world.

										        <h3>Which plants are natural pest controllers</h3>
										        <p>Pests have been associated with plants from time immemorial. It was only in the early 1940s that the 

													farmers in the USA adopted chemical pesticides to treat their crops to be able to yield a larger harvest. 

													In the recent years, pesticides have come with numerous hazards that destroyed the fertility of the soil 

													and more importantly, caused severe health issues with those in direct contact with it.
												</p>
												<p>
													In India, there are several plants that have the ability to repel insects and other pests. Many 

													agriculturists sow the seeds of these plants in order to protect their crops and these crops are known as 

													Companion plants. 
												</p>
												<p>
													Agriculturist choose Companion plants because they provide a hedged investment, increase yield, 

													create a protective shelter, increase pest suppression by preventing pest and fungi from destroying the 

													crop and used as trap cropping agents. Trap cropping allows for specific sets of plants to attract insects 

													and other pests away from the crops that are later harvested.
												</p>
												<p>
													Farmers have also taken to beneficial insects which prey on harmful insects and larvae. These include 

													the brachonids, chalcids, ichneumon wasps, ladybugs, lacewings, hover-flies, praying mantis and 

													nematodes. These insects can be attracted to fields and gardens and are natural predators to several 

													pests and in the process stops farmers from spraying their crops with harmful pesticides.

													Look no further than the humble Mint or Citronella Grass to weed out those uninvited guests. 

													Coriander repels aphids, colorado potato beetles and spider mites. Coriander can be found in super 

													markets and as a companion plant, it can supplement as a crop that you can enjoy along with 

													corresponding crop that you are harvesting. 
												</p>
												<p>
													The Common Lantana was first introduced in the Himalayan region in 1807 and has now spread to 

													almost all parts of India. It was brought into the Indian subcontinent particularly due to its delicate 

													flowers but is now used significantly as an agricultural method to ward off pests and insecticides. The 

													pretty pink Geraniums have over 442 species and are known to repeal leafhoppers, corn earworms and 

													the Small White. Garlic is a natural pest deterrent and is known to chase away rabbits as well. Other 

													important pest controlling plants are the onion, oregano, parsley, peppermint, radish, tobacco and the 

													tomato.
												</p>
												<p>
													Through the use of companion plants, farmers and gardeners can now protect themselves from harmful 

													insecticides and pesticides, and not have to set aside a portion of the crop which had gone bad due to 

													unchecked use of these sprays. In turn, these plants that are natural pest controllers can be enjoyed 

													along with the harvest and supplement the final produce.
